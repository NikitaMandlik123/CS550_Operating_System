## Flow of the code

The code takes command line inputs L and N denoting the level of tree and the number of children in each tree.

The steps are as follows :
1 )we are taking two user outputs into two arguments a) noOfLevel and  b) noOfChidren after converting it to integer using atoi
2 ) Calling a function from main , fork_r and passing 3 variables in it . 
  fork_r(level, noOfLevels,noOfChildren);
3 ) In fork_r ,for loop for level and child are created .Logic for the same is written.
